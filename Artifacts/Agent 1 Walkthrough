# Audio Processing Pipeline

Successfully built a robust local Python pipeline to ingest, standardize, and chunk audiobook files for downstream machine learning processing.

## Changes Made
- **[audio_processor.py](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's%20Reader/audio_processor.py)**: Added the main logic class `AudioProcessor`.
  - Implemented `.mp3` and `.m4b` file validation.
  - Used `ffprobe` to extract duration, format, and chapter metadata, saved to `metadata.json`.
  - Converted code to 16kHz mono `.wav` and efficiently split into 10-minute chunks using `ffmpeg-python` (`-segment_time 600`).
  - Added structured Python `logging` and exception handling for invalid files.
- **[test_audio.py](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's%20Reader/test_audio.py)**: Added a testing script that generates a mock 15-second audio file using `ffmpeg` and validates the resulting output directory.

## Validation Results
Ran `test_audio.py` which generated a dummy `dummy_test.mp3` file, ran the `AudioProcessor`, and successfully validated that the 16kHz `.wav` file was chunked and the `metadata.json` file was produced with the corresponding details.

```bash
Files generated in staging/dummy_test:
 - metadata.json (116 bytes)
 - chunk_000.wav (480118 bytes)
```
