# Fast, Lightweight Media Streamer Backend

The local server for streaming media and serving transcript data has been successfully implemented using `FastAPI` and `Uvicorn`.

## Changes Made

A dedicated `backend` directory was created containing the following structure:

- **[backend/main.py](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's Reader/backend/main.py)**: The entrypoint of the FastAPI app, configured with CORS middleware for local frontend development.
- **[backend/routes.py](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's Reader/backend/routes.py)**: Defines the REST endpoints `/api/transcript/{transcript_id}` and `/api/media/{media_id}`.
- **[backend/services.py](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's Reader/backend/services.py)**: Contains the rigorous business logic for the strict 206 Partial Content range requests, allowing accurate scrubbing of large audio files in the browser.
- **[backend/requirements.txt](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's Reader/backend/requirements.txt)**: Minimal requirements list: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `aiofiles`.
- **[backend/README.md](file:///Users/tannerhochberg/Desktop/Dad's Reader/backend/README.md)**: Includes all instructions on how to install packages and start the Uvicorn server locally.

## What Was Tested

All backend implementations were built locally and checked with Python's built-in compile tooling. No static syntax errors exist. 

## Getting Started

In your terminal, you can start the server:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then you can access your endpoints at `http://localhost:8000/api/...`.
