# Welcome to Active Translate! 📖

This app lets you listen to audiobooks and follow along with the transcript.

## How to Start the App

1.  Open the folder called `Dad's Reader` on your computer.
2.  Find the file named **Start Active Translate.command**.
3.  Double-click it!

A window will open and do some setup work (updates and checking files). Once it says **"✅ App is running!"**, you can open your web browser (like Chrome or Safari) and go to:

👉 **http://localhost:5173**

## How to Stop the App

1.  Go back to the window that opened when you double-clicked the file.
2.  Press **Control + C** on your keyboard, or just close the window.

## Updates

Every time you double-click **Start Active Translate.command**, it will automatically check for any updates I've made and install them for you. You don't need to do anything else!
